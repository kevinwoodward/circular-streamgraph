    <h1>Documentation:</h1><br>
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    -Select a preformatted dataset to display, or a random generation of a monthly dataset (uploads don't work due to issues with cross origin file errors)<br>
    -Use inner radius and outer radius sliders to adjust the size of the streamgraph<br>
    -Use the SVG dimensions slider to resize the group of SVG layers for better visibility<br>
    -Like a streamgraph, the data of the same time value stacks along the axes<br>
    -Color layers represent a cycle of data<br>
    -If the data is in weeks or months (e.g. the data points per key is 7 or 12), the axes will reflect that. Otherwise a number will simply be displayed.<br><br>

    <h3>Notes:</h3><br>
    -Tested in Chrome only, theoretically should work in most browsers.<br>
    -Using custom data sets. Loading files, referencing files, or manipulating files all throw Cross Origin Reference security errors, which is the reasoning behind the predetermined datasets.<br>
    -Screen flashing on redraw. This is due to the fact that the entire script reruns and removes all the SVG elements for a redraw<br>
